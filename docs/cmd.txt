ðŸ”¹ Basic Execution
python aut/runner.py


Runs all tests marked with "run": true in aut/config/testcase.json.

ðŸ”¹ Run Tests by Tags
python aut/runner.py --tags smoke


Runs only tests that have the smoke tag.

Multiple tags â†’ OR logic (any test matching at least one tag):

python aut/runner.py --tags smoke,login

ðŸ”¹ Override Environment
python aut/runner.py --env staging


Overrides the environment defined in config/testcase.json with "name": "staging".

Useful for switching between dev, staging, prod.

ðŸ”¹ Control Parallelism
python aut/runner.py --workers auto


Runs tests in parallel using all available CPU cores (requires pytest-xdist).

python aut/runner.py --workers 4


Runs tests in exactly 4 parallel workers.

ðŸ”¹ Dry Run (No Execution)
python aut/runner.py --dry-run


Only validates config, selects tests, and writes a manifest file.

Does not run pytest.

Good for checking which tests will run without executing them.

ðŸ”¹ Keep Cache Files
python aut/runner.py --keep-cache


Keeps __pycache__ and .pytest_cache (redirected under system temp).

Use when debugging pytest caching issues.

By default, caches are cleaned up after each run.

ðŸ”¹ Combine Options
python aut/runner.py --tags smoke --env staging --workers 4


Runs only smoke tests on the staging environment, using 4 workers.
